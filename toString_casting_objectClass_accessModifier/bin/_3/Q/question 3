 
 Q3) Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level ?
 
 ans: The problem occurs when there exist methods with the same 
 		signature in both the superclasses and subclass. On calling
  		the method, the compiler cannot determine which class method
   		to be called and even on calling which class method gets 
   		the priority thats why java does not support multiple inheritance.
