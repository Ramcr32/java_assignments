Q3) Explain abstract class and interface with an example.

answer: using interface achieve fully abstraction and 
using abstract class achieve 0 to 100% abstraction 
interface supports multiple inheritance but abstract class does not
in interface use can implement method with defalut and static method body
(onward 1.8 java). 
abstract class does not have any meaning without his child class. 
both are generate .class file.
interface method are bydefault public and abstract.
interface's static method is called by only itself, meanwhile 
static method does not participate in inheritace.
//abstract class
public abstract class A{
	public abstract void fun1();
	public abstract void fun2();
}
public class B extends A{
	public void fun1(){//overriden method
	}
	public void fun2(){//overriden method
	}
}
//interface
public interface A{
	void fun1();
	void fun2();
}
public class B implement A{
	void fun1(){}
	void fun2(){}
}
